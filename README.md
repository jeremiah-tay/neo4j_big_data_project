In this project:
I have created a Python script to demonstrate my understanding of knowledge graphs, a more efficient method for data extraction compared to traditional relational database management systems.
Additionally, I explored graph analytics and predictive analysis using knowledge graphs through Cypher queries

## Table of Content in the python script
- Automate Data Extraction
- Create Connection Class to link python script to neo4j survey
- Use Cypher queries to perform graph analytics and prediction analysis
- Use Cypher queries to visualise knowledge graphs
